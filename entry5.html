            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p>
                CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is a key principle for data reliability and security for 
                organizations. Confidentiality ensures sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals, 
                protecting privacy and disallowing unauthorized access. Integrity ensures information is valid, whole, and 
                not modified by unauthorized users, preserving its integrity. Availability ensures data and assets are accessible 
                when and where they are needed, even in the event of downtime or cyber-attacks. Organizations use various security 
                controls, including encryption, safe backups, and continuous monitoring, to protect these elements. 
                By applying the CIA Triad, institutions can maintain data security, minimize threats, and grant continuous 
                access to necessary information.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>The CIA Triad</h2>
            <p> 
                This entry isn't going to be super long. The CIA Triad is pretty straight forward and easy to understand.
                There are three fundamental principles in information security you should know: 
                Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, collectively referred to as the 
                ‘CIA Triad’. It serves as a guiding model for organizations to ensure their 
                data is protected by limiting access to authorized users (confidentiality), 
                maintaining its accuracy and consistency (integrity), and making it readily 
                available when needed (availability). Knowing and understanding the CIA Triad 
                is important because it is a core concept in cybersecurity, which can appear 
                in certification exams, technical interviews, and real-world situations. 
            </p>

            <div class="figure">
                <img src="media/entrymedia/entry5figure1.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                Think of the CIA Triad like a bank vault protecting valuable assets. 
                Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals, like verified 
                customers and bank employees, can access specific safety deposit boxes, 
                blocking unauthorized access with security measures like locked doors and 
                keycards. Integrity guarantees that the money and documents inside remain 
                unchanged, using transaction logs and surveillance to prevent fraud. 
                Availability ensures that when customers need their assets, they are 
                accessible and can be maintained, avoiding downtime with backup power, 
                redundant records, and emergency programs. Just as a bank holds the safety 
                of financial assets, cybersecurity experts protect digital data using the 
                foundation of the CIA Triad. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The CIA Triad can also be applied to Universities and their students. 
                Take the University of New Haven for example. It utilizes the CIA Triad 
                to secure student and faculty information. Confidentiality is supported 
                by password-protected stduent portals (MyCharger), multi-factor authentication 
                (MFA), and encrypted databases. Integrity is provided by frequent system audits 
                and backups of data. Availability is upheld by servers, DDoS protection, and 
                IT support services, ensuring students can access online courses, email, and 
                university resources. 
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
            <p><b>Who are you? Are you allowed to do this? What are you trying to access?</b></p>

            <p>
                Confidentiality, which is roughly equivalent to privacy, involves not making 
                unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information. Information is often classified 
                based on the degree of damage that would result from its exposure so that 
                organizations can apply the appropriate level of security controls. 
            </p>

            <div class="figure">
                <img src="media/entrymedia/entry5figure2.png">
            </div>

            <p>
                For confidentiality, organizations typically provide additional training to the 
                staff handling sensitive data. This includes risk factor identification, 
                good password hygiene, and awareness of social engineering attacks that 
                cyber attackers utilize to exploit human weaknesses. Various technical 
                safeguards assist with confidentiality. Data encryption protects information 
                both in transit and in storage, and user authentication processes—such as 
                passwords, security tokens, biometric scanning, and two-factor authentication 
                (2FA)—offer extra security. Online banking, for example, requires an account or 
                routing number, and social media sites require user IDs and passwords to 
                restrict access. For extremely sensitive data, even more drastic measures 
                may be necessary, such as storing information on air-gapped systems, offline 
                storage devices, or holding only hard-copy records. By implementing these 
                measures, organizations can render unauthorized access more challenging and 
                reduce the risk of data breaches.<sup><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Confidentiality-integrity-and-availability-CIA" target="_blank">1</a></sup>

                        WashU St. Louis University systems are an example of how an educational 
                        institution applies the CIA Triad to protect data. Confidentiality is 
                        maintained through WUSTLKey and WashU 2FA, ensuring that only authorized 
                        students, faculty, and staff can access university systems. 
                        Researchers further protect their work by encrypting files, 
                        using password-protected resources, and restricting access to 
                        trained team members. These measures help safeguard sensitive 
                        information, ensuring privacy and reducing the risk of cyber 
                        threats like ransomware attacks. <sup><a href="https://informationsecurity.wustl.edu/items/confidentiality/ " target="_blank">2</a></sup>

            <br><br>
            <h2>Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                The second element of the CIA Triad is integrity, which makes sure that data never changes from its initial accuracy and 
                consistency, without being modified by legitimate users. When data is faulty or manipulated, organizations may end up 
                with the wrong users receiving sensitive information or failing to receive critical updates. For example, in the 
                medical field, patient data must be accurate so that medical updates reach the appropriate people. If a hospital 
                updates another patient's record inaccurately or makes a diagnosis in the wrong place, it can cause privacy violations 
                or even medical mistakes. Just like business records, software, games, they all rely on data integrity. Integrity in 
                cybersecurity is like maintaining fair gameplay in a video game. Imagine you're playing an online multiplayer game 
                where scores, player stats, and in-game currency must be accurate and protected. If a hacker modifies the game’s 
                code to give themselves unlimited health or currency, it disrupts the game’s balance and fairness, just like how 
                data corruption or unauthorized changes can compromise an organization’s integrity. To prevent this, game developers 
                implement anti-cheat systems, encrypted leaderboards, and secure cloud saves to ensure that data remains 
                unaltered and legitimate.<sup><a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-the-cia-triad-and-why-is-it-important" target="_blank">3</a></sup>

            <br><br>
            <h2>Availability</h2>
            <p>
                The last element of the CIA Triad is availability, which makes sure that data is always accessible to authorized users. 
                Making sure resources and services are still accessible even in the event of a cyberattack, hardware breakdown, or 
                natural disaster. As businesses increasingly rely on digital infrastructure, uptime and minimizing disruptions are
                 now core parts of cybersecurity. Some of the most important measures for availability are continuity and disaster 
                 recovery plans, impact analyses, and service level agreements (SLAs) that define uptime targets. This is achieved 
                 by putting in place redundant systems, backup power sources, load balancers, and caches to prevent single points 
                 of failure. In addition, regular system testing and maintenance guarantee detection of and reaction to possible 
                 threats before they cause outages. 
            </p>

            <div class="figure">
                <img src="media/entrymedia/entry5figure4.png">
            </div>

            <p>Normal availability threats include power outages, network breakdowns, hardware breakdowns, and cyber threats like DDoS 
                (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attacks. When a critical server crashes or a website gets bombed with traffic as a 
                result of an attack, users may fail to access essential services, for instance. Resilient infrastructure and 
                preventive security controls enable organizations to limit downtime and deliver continued access to data and systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in healthcare, hospitals employ electronic health records (EHRs) to provide care to patients. In the event of a 
                cyberattack like a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack or ransomware and disconnection is caused, the physicians and 
                nurses may not be able to access critical health information, potentially jeopardizing patients' lives. Similarly, in online shops, 
                website down time can translate into lost sales as well as angry customers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to be available, organizations make use of server redundancy, cloud storage, load balancing, and cybersecurity measures 
                to prevent downtime and attacks. Scheduled system maintenance, security updates, and DDoS protection see to it that users can 
                always view the information and services they need, guaranteeing reliability and trust in electronic systems.<sup><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/cia-triad-confidentiality-integrity-availability.html" target="_blank">5</a></sup>

                    The University of New Haven employs the CIA Triad to protect its information assets to ensure they remain 
                    available when required. Availability guarantees such critical systems as Blackboard, student portals, 
                    email services, and research databases are accessible and usable without any disruption. Lack of availability 
                    would render the activities of a university, from the submission of assignments to accessing courseware, 
                    completely halted. For assurance of availability, the university implements cybersecurity to assist in warding 
                    off threats like ransomware attacks that attempt to deny system access until a ransom is paid. Periodic security 
                    patches, intrusion detection systems, and firewalls assist in warding off attacks as per the view of the 
                    university's IT department. Students and staff also play their part in guaranteeing availability by reporting 
                    potential phishing, not clicking on unfamiliar links, and utilizing university-approved storage services like 
                    OneDrive for saving important documents. All these steps taken by the University of New Haven ensure that 
                    important academic and research content is available and secure.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This entry wasn't super long, at least compared to the others. That's because the CIA Triad is pretty straight forward. 
                Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, and that's it. the general model applied to secure information within any 
                institution, including educational institutions like the University of New Haven. Confidentiality ensures that 
                sensitive data is beyond the reach of unauthorized individuals, thus providing privacy for students, instructors, 
                and research. Maintaining integrity ensures that data is accurate and avoids unauthorized changes or corruption of 
                essential information. Lastly, availability ensures that resources and information can be used whenever there is a 
                need, essential in ensuring the seamless operations of an online infrastructure. Businesses can prevent likely threats of 
                attack such as cyberattacks by practicing caution like encrypting information, secure backup measures, and real-time 
                monitoring by users. Utilizing the CIA Triad helps institutions like the University of New Haven create a solid 
                cybersecurity strategy, where information is secure and accessible, and business continuity and trust are guaranteed.
