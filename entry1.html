            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p>
                Network sandboxes are an underrated yet powerful cybersecurity tool. Much like virtual machines isolate malware, 
                network sandboxes safely analyze suspicious files before they reach a user’s system. By executing potential threats 
                in a controlled environment, they help detect and block malware without risking real systems. Network sandboxes are 
                isolated environments used to safely test potentially malicious files over network traffic without affecting the rest of your 
                system.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
            <p>
                We all know what virtual machines are and what they do. But if you don’t, think of them like emulators—except 
                instead of running a game like Kingdom Hearts on a PS2 emulator, a virtual machine (VM) emulates an entire 
                operating system on your computer. <br><br>
                Using software like VirtualBox, you can load an .iso file of an OS—Ubuntu, Debian, Windows XP, etc.—and run it 
                inside your main system. You also get full control over resources, deciding how much storage, memory, and CPU 
                power the VM can use. <br><br>
                A common cybersecurity use case for virtual machines (VMs) is malware analysis—testing, reverse-engineering, 
                and studying malware in a controlled environment. The reason? You definitely don’t want to run malware on your 
                personal computer. <br><br>
                Now, can malware escape a virtual machine? Technically no, but in rare cases, yes. <br><br>
                Malware cannot break out of a VM on its own—it requires an exploit. For example, if you have a shared folder between 
                your VM and host machine, malware could use it to squeeze through and escape. Otherwise, if your VM gets infected, 
                you can simply shut it down or restore a clean snapshot, leaving your main system unharmed. More information about 
                the likelihood of malware escaping your VM can be found 
                <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/222502/how-concerned-should-i-be-about-vm-escapes" target="_blank">here</a>.
                However do not take it as professional advice, as it is from an infosec forum. 
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Network Sandboxes</h2>
            <p>
                Now, apply that same logic to network security. If a network service detects suspicious activity—say, a 
                potentially harmful file download—it can sandbox the file inside an isolated "virtual machine" environment. 
                If the file turns out to be malicious, the service closes, preventing the malware from ever reaching the actual 
                system. This is what a network sandbox does. <br><br>
                A network sandbox is an isolated testing environment that allows security teams to observe, analyze, detect, 
                and block suspicious activity on a network. It serves as an additional layer of defense against previously 
                unknown attack vectors. By running potentially malicious files in a controlled, segregated environment that 
                mimics a real operating system, security teams can conduct advanced malware analysis without risking the 
                integrity of the actual network.<sup><a href="https://www.vmware.com/topics/network-sandbox" target="_blank">1</a></sup> <br><br>
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>In Action</h2>
            <ol>
                <li value="1"><p style="margin-left: 10px;">A user downloads a file from the internet. This could be an email attachment, a software installer, or any other type of file.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Before the file reaches the user’s device, the data is intercepted by a network 
                    security gateway. A network security gateway is a device that acts as the entry point to a network, filtering and 
                    inspecting all incoming and outgoing traffic. Examples can be a firewalls, IDS, or IPS.<sup><a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/firewall-vs-ids-vs-ips" target="_blank">2</a></sup> 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <div style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(7, 224, 148); padding: 2px;">
                    <p style="margin-left: 10px; opacity: 0.7;">A firewall sets the boundaries for network traffic, blocking or allowing data based on predetermined protocols. 
                        An IDS watches over network activities, flagging any irregularities for review, without directly affecting 
                        data flow. An IPS plays an assertive role, not just detecting, but also preventing identified threats 
                        from compromising the network.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <li><p style="margin-left: 10px;">The file data is then redirected and sent to a network sandbox, which then executes an isolated virtual environment 
                    designed to safely run and analyze files. The sandbox monitors the file’s behavior, checking for signs of malware, 
                    such as suspicious system modifications, network connections to malicious servers, or attempts to alter files or 
                    processes.<sup><a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-sandboxing/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">If the file behaves normally, it’s flagged as safe and continues to the main system. 
                    If the file behaves maliciously, it blocks it from reaching the user. On top of blocking the file, a network sandbox 
                    also creates reports on its malicious activity and can take measures to alert the security team, log details about 
                    the threat, or send the malware to cybersecurity researchers for further analysis.
                    <sup><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/threat-intelligence/cybersecurity-sandboxing/#:~:text=Bart%20Lenaerts%2DBergmans%20%2D%20September%2011,Let's%20get%20started" target="_blank">4</a></sup>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 10px;">Even if the malware tries to execute harmful actions inside the sandbox, 
                        it remains contained because the sandbox is isolated from the real system. Once analysis is complete, 
                        the sandbox environment is reset or deleted, ensuring that no traces of the malware persist. 
                    </p>

            <h2>Sandbox Tools</h2>
            <p>
                Several security tools leverage network sandboxing to detect and analyze threats before they reach a 
                user’s system. These tools execute suspicious files in isolated environments, observing their behavior to 
                determine if they are malicious. Here are some notable network sandboxing technologies:

            <ul>
                <li><p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>Cuckoo Sandbox</b></p></li>

                    <li>
                        <p style="margin-left: 10px;">A Cuckoo Sandbox is a free and open-source application that allows malware to be 
                            launched in a safe and isolated environment. The concept is that the sandbox tricks the virus into 
                            believing it has infected a real host. After that, the sandbox will log the malware's activities 
                            and provide a report detailing the things the virus tried to accomplish in this safe setting.

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Network sandboxing is a powerful yet often overlooked cybersecurity tool. Similar to how virtual machines 
                contain malware in a controlled environment, network sandboxes isolate and analyze suspicious files
                before they reach a system. By acting as a proactive defense layer, they help security teams detect and 
                neutralize threats before they can cause harm. Despite their effectiveness, network sandboxes don’t 
                receive as much attention as traditional security measures like firewalls and antivirus software. 
                Hopfully you've learned a few things about network sandboxing and how it helps protect a network.
