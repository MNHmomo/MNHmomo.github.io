        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>
          Audio steganography hides secret messages within audio files by subtly altering their data, making the hidden info 
          inaudible to humans but detectable by computers. Common techniques include Least Significant Bit (LSB) 
          insertion and phase coding. It’s used in cybersecurity to covertly transmit data, sometimes maliciously. 
          Tools like MP3Stego embed messages during audio compression but require uncompressed WAV files in a specific format. 
          Proper audio preparation and careful embedding preserve sound quality while concealing data effectively. 
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Steganography is concealing piece of information within another message or physical object, usually to avoid detection. 
          It’s similar to cryptography, but unlike obscuring a message, it blatantly hides it completely within something. 
          You can combine both steganography and encryption to create that extra step of hiding or protecting information. 
          Regarding the use of it in cybersecurity, it’s involved in hiding malicious content or instructions, 
          that a computer can then recognize and execute, within seemingly innocent files like images, audio, or text, 
          making it difficult for security tools to detect. To better understand it, think of it as hiding a secret QR 
          code within an image, that someone like you and I would not be able to see or even recognize. However, the computer can.  
          It can then execute whatever the “QR code” instructs. 
          You can see how this can be exploited.<sup><a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-steganography" target="_blank">1</a></a></sup>

        <h2>Types of Steganography</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Text Steganography</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              With text steganography, a secret message is hidden within a text message. 
              The first letter of each sentence could be used to create the secret message 
              in the most basic type of text steganography. Additional text steganography 
              methods could involve encoding information with punctuation or introducing 
              relevant errors.<sup><a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/what-is-steganography-guide-meaning-types-tools/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Image Steganography</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Image steganography is the process of encoding confidential data into a digital picture. 
              This method is predicated on the fact that subtle variations in image color or noise are 
              extremely hard for the human eye to pick up on. For instance, one image can be buried 
              inside another by representing the hidden image with the least important bits of each 
              pixel in the original image. Or like the analogy mentioned before, it’s like hiding a QR code in an image. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Video Steganography</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A more advanced form of image steganography that can encrypt whole videos is called video steganography. 
              Each video frame can convey a distinct image since digital videos are portrayed as a series of sequential images, 
              making a coherent video invisible. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Audio Steganography</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This is a type of steganography we'll be specifically looking at in this entry.Similar to pictures and videos, audio files can be utilized to hide information. "Backmasking," a straightforward type of audio steganography, 
              involves playing secret messages backwards on a tape, requiring the listener to play the entire track backwards. 
              Similar to image steganography, more advanced methods may use the least important bits of each byte in the audio file. 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Network Steganography</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Finally, network steganography is an ingenious digital steganography method that conceals data within network traffic. 
              For instance, information may be hidden in network packet payloads or TCP/IP headers. Even the time interval between 
              sending packets can be used by the sender to convey information. 
              Based on the intervals between transmitting various packets, the sender can potentially transmit information. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to note: <b>steganography itself does not execute code.</b> It’s simply the method of hiding data. 
          However, what’s hidden—such as malware, shellcode, or malicious URLs—can be extracted and executed by 
          other programs. The true danger lies in its ability to evade detection, not execute by itself.

        <h2>Audio Steganography</h2>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Least Significant Bit (LSB) Insertion</strong><br>
              LSB insertion is one of the simplest and most commonly used methods. It involves modifying the least 
              significant bits of audio samples to encode the secret data. Since these bits contribute minimally to the 
              overall sound, their alteration typically goes unnoticed by listeners. For example, in a 16-bit audio sample, 
              changing the last bit from 0 to 1 alters the sample value insignificantly, preserving audio quality. 
              <sup><a href="https://svenruppert.com/2024/04/17/audio-steganography-in-more-detail/" target="_blank">3</a></sup>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Phase Coding</strong><br>
              This technique embeds information by altering the phase components of the audio signal. 
              The human auditory system is less sensitive to phase changes, making this method effective for 
              hiding data without affecting perceived sound quality. Phase coding is more robust against common 
              audio processing operations like compression.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Echo Hiding</strong><br>
              Echo hiding introduces short echoes into the audio signal to represent hidden data. 
              By carefully controlling the delay and amplitude of these echoes, the method ensures 
              that they are imperceptible to listeners while still encoding information. 
              This technique offers greater resistance to signal processing attacks compared to LSB insertion.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Spread Spectrum</strong><br>
              In spread spectrum steganography, the secret data is distributed across a wide frequency range 
              of the audio signal. This approach minimizes the impact on any single frequency component, 
              making the hidden data less detectable and more resilient to noise and compression.

            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>Backmasking</strong><br>
              Backmasking involves recording messages in reverse within an audio track. When played forward, 
              the message is hidden; playing the track backward reveals the concealed information. While more 
              of a novelty, this method has been used in music and media to embed hidden messages. 
              <sup><a href="https://www.eccouncil.org/cybersecurity-exchange/ethical-hacking/what-is-steganography-guide-meaning-types-tools/" target="_blank">5</a></sup>

          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Audio steganography is executed through a structured process that hides digital data within audio signals in a way that remains 
          inaudible to the human ear. It begins with selecting a cover audio file, typically in an uncompressed format like WAV, because 
          it offers more predictable bit patterns. The secret message is then converted into a binary stream. One common technique used 
          is Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion, where each bit of the secret message replaces the least significant bit of an audio 
          sample—this subtle change has minimal impact on audio quality. Other advanced methods include phase coding, which alters the 
          phase of the audio signal to carry information, and echo hiding, where controlled echoes are introduced to encode data. 
          Once the embedding is complete, the modified audio file is saved, preserving both the audio fidelity and the embedded information. 
          Extraction works in reverse—by scanning specific bits or signal features to recover the hidden message. Tools like Steghide 
          and MP3Stego automate these steps, embedding messages during compression or post-processing.
