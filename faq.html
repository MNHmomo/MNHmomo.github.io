        <h2>Difference Between Homograph Attacks and Typosquatting</h2>
        <p>03/31/25</p>
        <p>
          Homograph attacks exploit visually similar characters from different alphabets 
          (e.g., "gооgle.com" using Cyrillic "о" instead of Latin) to trick users into visiting 
          malicious sites, while typosquatting relies on common misspellings (e.g., "gogle.com") 
          to redirect users to fraudulent domains. A real-life example of a homograph attack was 
          "аррӏе.com," which mimicked Apple's official site using Cyrillic letters. Meanwhile, 
          Google sued a typosquatter in 2006 for "goggle.com," which tricked users with deceptive ads. 
          Both attacks highlight the need for URL verification and security measures to prevent 
          phishing and malware threats.

        <h2>What is "Evil Twin" Wi-Fi?</h2>
        <p>03/25/25</p>
        <p>
          An Evil Twin attack occurs when an attacker clones a legitimate Wi-Fi network to deceive users into 
          connecting to it. Once connected, the attacker can intercept login credentials, 
          monitor unencrypted traffic, and perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, compromising sensitive data. 
          To protect against this, always verify SSIDs before connecting and avoid using open Wi-Fi networks 
          without VPN encryption, ensuring a more secure connection.

        <h2>What are air-gapped attacks, and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>03/24/25</p>
        <p>
          Air-gapped attacks target systems that are physically isolated from networks. 
          Attackers use techniques like electromagnetic emissions, ultrasonic signals, 
          or compromised USB devices to extract data.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a hardware implant attack, and how does it differ from traditional malware?</h2>
        <p>03/18/25</p>
        <p>
          A hardware implant attack involves physically modifying or adding a malicious component to a 
          device (e.g., motherboard chips, USB devices) to intercept, alter, or obstain data. 
          Unlike software malware, hardware implants persist across reboots and cannot be removed 
          with traditional antivirus tools.

        <h2>What is a "supply chain attack," and why is it dangerous?</h2>
        <p>03/17/25</p>
        <p>
          A supply chain attack compromises software, hardware, or services before they reach the end user. Attackers 
          inject malicious code into trusted updates, developer tools, or hardware components, leading to a widespread attack 
          (e.g., SolarWinds attack).

        <h2>Can encrypted data be hacked without brute force?</h2>
        <p>03/13/25</p>
        <p>
          Yes, attackers may use <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/side-channel-attack" target="_blank">side-channel attacks</a> , like power analysis or <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/electromagnetic-leakage" target="_blank">electromagnetic leakage</a> , 
          to extract cryptographic keys. Additionally, <a href="https://www.dekra.com/en/fault-injection-attacks/" target="_blank">fault injection attacks</a> (such as voltage manipulation) 
          can disrupt encryption processes, leading to data exposure.

        <h2>Is using a VPN always safe for anonymity?</h2>
        <p>03/10/25</p>
        <p>
          No. Some VPNs log user activity, suffer from DNS leaks, or use weak encryption. 
          Also, nation-state actors can perform correlation attacks, monitoring VPN <a href="https://aviatrix.com/learn-center/cloud-network-security/egress-and-ingress/" target="_blank">egress and ingress points</a> to identify users.

        <h2>What is "fileless malware," and how does it persist?</h2>
        <p>03/09/25</p>
        <p>
          Fileless malware operates in memory without writing files to disk, often using 
          PowerShell, registry modifications, or WMI scripts to execute malicious code. 
          This makes it difficult for traditional antivirus solutions to detect.

        <h2>What is the difference between a virus and malware?</h2>
        <p>03/05/25</p>
        <p>
          A virus is a specific type of malware (malicious software) that attaches itself to a 
          file or program and spreads when that file is executed. It often requires user action, 
          such as opening an infected file, to run. Malware is a broader term that includes all 
          types of malicious software, such as viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, 
          and adware. While a virus is just one type of malware, other types can spread without 
          user action, exploit vulnerabilities, or steal data.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h2>What is a VPN?</h2>
        <p>03/03/25</p>
        <p>
          Essentially, a virtual private network, or VPN, is a secure private network that 
          is established by encrypting an immense network. A  VPN keeps hackers and attackers, 
          or at least tries its best to, from accessing your computer systems and private 
          information by enabling you to browse anonymously without being discovered by 
          unauthorized users.

        <h2>How do I identify fake phishing/scam emails? </h2>
        <p>02/26/25</p>
        <p>
          Any unsolicited outreach should be approached with suspicion. 
          Phishing and scams are examples of "if it seems too good to be true, 
          it probably is." Look for attributes that seem “off”. Such as an unknown 
          and sudden email, unusual domain name, or outright attempting to obtain 
          information by asking for passwords, payment information, addresses, 
          social security number, or other personal information. Another way is 
          to search up your exact situation and see if others have had similar experiences. 
          That way you can see what to look out for and what to be aware of.

      <div>
          <h2>What are zero-day vulnerabilities?</h2>
          <p>02/24/25</p>
          <p>
            Zero-day vulnerabilities are security flaws in software or hardware that are 
            unknown to the vendor or developer. Since they are not yet patched, 
            attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities before a fix is released, 
            making them a significant security risk. The term "zero-day" refers to 
            the fact that the developer has had "zero days" to address the vulnerability 
            when it is discovered.
