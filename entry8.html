            <h2><a href="https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">x64dbg</a></h2>
            <p>
                x64dbg is an open-source, free debugger for Windows that is widely used for 
                reverse engineering and malware analysis. It has the functionality of stepping 
                through code execution, so it’s useful for debugging faults and analyzing 
                malicious code. x64dbg was designed for 64-bit architecture but also has a 
                32-bit counterpart, x32dbg. Malware analysts do not typically begin with a 
                debugger but first conduct static and behavioral analysis to understand a 
                malware sample's behavior. Once you have a preliminary understanding, 
                x64dbg can be used to unpack malware and examine its functionality at the 
                assembly code level. Analysts reverse compile Windows executables 
                (.exe, .dll) to uncover their internal operations. 

                <div style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(7, 224, 148); padding: 2px;">
                    <p style="margin-left: 10px; opacity: 0.7;">
                        Malware analysis typically begins with static analysis, where analysts 
                        inspect the malware file without executing it, searching for metadata, 
                        strings, and file structure for clues. This is then followed by 
                        behavioral analysis, where the malware is executed in a virtual 
                        setup to observe what it does, including file modifications, 
                        registry modifications, or network traffic. Finally, code 
                        analysis (reverse engineering) is performed with the assistance of 
                        tools like x64dbg to step through the assembly code of malware, 
                        unpack it, and analyze its behavior.

            <p>
                This one is a pretty cool website. It isn’t a software tool, or any network 
                analyzer and debugger, but in fact a sort of checklist for your computer safety. 
                Digital Defense is a personal security checklist to help users strengthen and be 
                aware of their digital safety and privacy. Users can also track their progress 
                and mark actions as complete, making them one step closer to enhancing their 
                security. Although it does bring up the question of whether you can be 
                completely secure online. The platform provides advice for many different 
                categories.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/bunkerity/bunkerweb" target="_blank">BunkerWeb</a></h2>
            <p>
                BunkerWebis a Web Application Firewall (WAF). It protects your websites and 
                applications right out of the box. Built on NGINX, it's security by design, 
                with HTTPS on by default, strong security rules, and bot protection. 
                It works great with Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and more, and you can manage 
                it through an easy-to-use web interface—no involved setup necessary. 
                You can customize security settings, block bad traffic, limit requests, 
                and add extra features with plugins. Best of all, it’s free and open-source 
                (AGPLv3), with professional support available if needed. Just a nice little 
                firewall tool you can mess around with to better understand how blocking 
                network traffic works, and firewalls in general. Read this entry about network 
                security mechanisms like firewalls, IDS, and IPS.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/A-poc/RedTeam-Tools" target="_blank">Red Team Tools</a></h2>
            <p>
                While not a tool itself, this GitHub repository contains a thoroughly curated 
                collection of 130+ red team tools and resources. The collection contains 
                dedicated and general security tools that can be used for red teaming. 
                It contains recon software like Shodan and gobuster, execution tools like 
                Mimikatz and PowerSploit, defense evasion methods like Invoke-Obfuscation, 
                command and control (C2) tools like Metasploit and Covenant, and data 
                exfiltration methods through DNS tunneling and Google Drive exploits. 
                It also provides 17 red team tips on how to evade security controls, 
                avoid detection, and improve operational security. This repository is a 
                one-stop-shop for security professionals conducting offensive security 
                audits and penetration testing. This collection of security and red team 
                tools are heavily encouraged not to be used maliciously, but purely for 
                educational purposes.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/AzeemIdrisi/PhoneSploit-Pro" target="_blank">PhoneSploit</a></h2>
            <p>
                PhoneSploit is a powerful and simple to use Python program that automates 
                Android penetration testing using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and 
                Metasploit-Framework. It allows remote exploitation of devices with an 
                available ADB port (TCP 5555) and complete control through a Meterpreter 
                session at the click of a button. Besides hacking, it also functions as an 
                independent ADB tool, enabling the user to connect Android devices both 
                through Wi-Fi and USB, send/receive files, install/uninstall apps, take a 
                screenshot, or record audio or video, and mirror the screen. More sophisticated 
                tools are extracting SMS and call logs, device unlocking, network analysis, 
                and remote control. PhoneSploit is intended for ethical hacking, penetration 
                testing, and security research, helping users understand and defend against 
                ADB vulnerabilities. Again, use only with permission.

            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jassics/security-study-plan" target="_blank">Security Study Plan</a></h2>
            <p>
                This is just a little bonus that I thought might be helpful, to me and you. 
                This repo is created by Sanjeev Jaiswal, who based on his bio is a “A seasoned 
                security professional with 15+ years of experience.” This Cybersecurity Study 
                Plan is a structured roadmap to prepare future security engineers to specialize 
                in domains like Pentesting, AppSec, Cloud Security, DevSecOps, and more by 
                acquiring important skills, tools, and free/paid materials. It covers overall 
                security skills, AWS/GCP security, web and API security, threat modeling, 
                GRC, and newer domains like Azure security, Kubernetes security, cryptography, 
                and secure software development. Designed for those who have a technical 
                inclination, this course involves 3-4 hours of daily study for six months, 
                with emphasis on hands-on experimentation, many drafts, and hacker mindset. 
                It eliminates guesswork by using well-established learning paths, eschewing 
                time wasted on piecewise material.
