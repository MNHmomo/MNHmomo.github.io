        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <p>
          The OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnections, a model explaining how
          different systems of computers communicate by dividing the communication process into
          seven distinct layers, each with its own function. This allows for standardized
          communication between various devices and software across different networks. It’s
          basically a blueprint for protocols in network communication. The layers go: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>[7] Application Layer: Human and computer interaction, user interface applications.</p></li>
          <li><p>[6] Presentation Layer: Ensures data encryption, compression, and is in usable format.</p></li>
          <li><p>[5] Session Layer: Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions and ports.</p></li>
          <li><p>[4] Transport Layer: Transmits data using protocols; including TCP and UDP</p></li>
          <li><p>[3] Network Layer: Routes data packets using IP addresses.</p></li>
          <li><p>[2] Data Link Layer: Ensures reliable node-to-node data transfer.</p></li>
          <li><p>[1] Physical Layer: Transmits raw bits over a physical medium.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>OSI Model</h2>
        <p>
          The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection) is like a postal system, where the Physical
          Layer is the roads and trucks transporting letters, the Data Link Layer ensures the right
          recipient using an address on the envelope, the Network Layer routes mail through sorting
          centers like IP addresses, the Transport Layer decides delivery reliability like registered or
          regular mail, the Session Layer opens the mailbox to receive messages, the Presentation
          Layer translates foreign languages like encryption and decryption, and the Application
          Layer is where the recipient finally reads the letter.
          <br><br>
          Essentially the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model was created to be a blueprint
          for how computer systems would talk to each other over the internet. The term "open
          systems" means that the OSI model is publicly available for anyone to use. While it was
          originally meant to replace all older networking standards, today, it is a helpful guide for
          understanding how network communication works. Now the OSI model is important
          because it organizes network communication into layers. Where each layer handles a
          specific task. This is helpful because it breaks down communication into smaller and
          manageable tasks.<sup><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/" target="_blank">1</a></sup>

        </div>

        <h2>[7] Application Layer</h2>
        <p>
          This is the layer that interacts with the user through applications and user interfaces, just
            as you are interacting with this website. Clicking all its links and opening images in a new
            tab. Many protocols run at this layer, such as <b>DNS, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, NFS, POP3, SMTP,
            and SSH</b>. We’ll go more into depth on those protocols in a future blog.<sup><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4317616" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
            <br><br>
            <div style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(7, 224, 148); padding: 2px;">
              <p style="margin-left: 10px; opacity: 0.7;">
                <b>DNS - </b>Translates human-readable domain names (such as <a href="https://www.bashbreach.com/">bashbreach.com</a>) into IP addresses for network routing.
                <br><br>
                <b>FTP - </b>Transfers files between a client and a server over a network, often used for website management.
                <br><br>
                <b>HTTP - </b>The foundation of web communication, allowing the transfer of web pages and resources.
                <br><br>
                <b>HTTPS - </b>A secure version of HTTP that encrypts data using SSL/TLS to protect user privacy.
                <br><br>
                <b>NFS - </b>Enables remote access to shared files over a network, commonly used in UNIX/Linux environments.
                <br><br>
                <b>POP3 - </b>Retrieves emails from a mail server to a local client and typically deletes them from the server afterward.
                <br><br>
                <b>SMTP - </b>Sends and relays emails between mail servers and from clients to servers.
                <br><br>
                <b>SSH - </b>Provides secure remote access to systems and encrypted communication over a network.
              </p>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Application Layer is the closest to the end user, providing services and interfaces that
          enable applications to communicate over the network. It directly interacts with software
          applications. When you open a web browser to visit a website, like bashbreach.com, the
          application layer uses HTTP to send your request to the server, and the server responds
          back with the requested data. This top layer basically provides network services for user
          interface applications, such as email, file transfer, or web browsing.
        </p>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="media/entrymedia/entry3figure2.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
          In terms of cybersecurity, the Application Layer ensures that data is properly formatted,
          encrypted, and authenticated, in addition to just communication. It is very important for
          secure browsing, remote access, and file sharing. This layer deals with user interaction,
          while the underlying layers handle the transport and delivery of data.<sup><a href="https://www.f5.com/glossary/application-layer-security" target="_blank">3</a></sup>
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>[6] Presentation Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The Presentation Layer ensures that data sent from one system's Application Layer can be
          properly understood by another. It handles formatting, translation, encryption, and
          compression to facilitate seamless communication. It acts as a bridge between the raw
          data and its meaningful representation for applications. 
          <br><br>
          You can think of this layer as the
          translator of the OSI model. It is where the human-readable programming languages are
          translated into machine code instructions used by the lower layers. Just like in its name,
          it’s responsible for how that data is presented to lower-level machines. Data that's coming
          from the network applications, like sending an email, clicking a button link, downloading a
          file, or loading the latest BashBreach blog. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When formatting and encoding happens in this layer, data is converted into a standard
          format (e.g., converting text files between ASCII and Unicode) so different systems can
          interpret it correctly. Data compression can also happen here, where file sizes are reduced
          for faster transmission, commonly used in media streaming and file transfers (e.g., MP3,
          JPEG, PNG). Data is also secured by encrypting it before transmission and decrypting it
          upon arrival (e.g., SSL/TLS used in HTTPS).<sup><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6014631" target="_blank">4</a></sup>
        </p>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="media/entrymedia/entry3figure3.png">
        </div>

        <p>
          In general, the work of the Presentation Layer is data formatting/compression, security
          encryption, and converting computer code to network formatted code so systems can
          know what the heck to do
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>[5] Session Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The Session Layer will establish, maintain, and terminate the communication session
          between devices. It ensures data exchanges occur in an orderly fashion. This enables
          applications to be continuously connected and not interfered with. Authentication can also occur at the start of a session, allowing all subsequent
          communication within that session to be trusted without requiring constant reauthentication. Additionally, the session layer can include checkpoints in data
          transmission, so if data is lost or corrupted, only the portion after the last checkpoint
          needs to be resent—minimizing retransmissions and shielding higher layers from network
          disruptions. <sup><a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/37556683/THE_OSI_MODEL_OVERVIEW_ON_THE_SEVEN_LAYERS-607-libre.pdf?1430932201=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DTHE_OSI_MODEL_OVERVIEW_ON_THE_SEVEN_LAYE.pdf&Expires=1738718333&Signature=M17N0kPxtyQ-WenzSi8NOPb2WiWZ~O5D2XwKqeH9UvXw5cnifBdDyjA~bWohaI3OUThmZ-MA2HiI8CRJFwm7affGuSnlmdFsBLSGDKM0Y8inB98iCrmjXKpTvrszHhpw~K7gNcrrEsgrFTdOwI~AvIdfGQP1Z4Y8dsNomXWTGCDpjZawJOF4lGozYa49xZVAlDaQHOPS34gmcEBUSO9z7cCQup9jTuHlckyKO3UwqYnHRkUCqZtRQUusJsrJo8EJCZDT9lw7h2Dx745wxL8GLmUUeSVs0XlFFK5GIEEHXoUwxpm4pwWQj2jCGnKaRB0DuUm2XHzSFBhL~6VvkMgyAw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA" target="_blank">5</a></sup>
        </p>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="media/entrymedia/entry3figure4.png">
        </div>

        <p>
          Consider two guests at a party to better understand the session layer. Usually, they would
          greet one another at the beginning of the gathering, which would start a lengthy
          conversation between them. One session would be the duration of the chat between their
          hello's and goodbye’s. The transport layer, which we’ll discuss later, would be the 
          sentences they exchange. Even a single session could be briefly interrupted. For example,
          one person might pause to speak to someone else, then resume the chat with the original
          person without starting a new conversation, like when you pause and resume a download.
          The session would come to an end when they said their goodbyes. Perhaps they will run
          into each other later and then say hello again, starting a new session
          <br>
          <div style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(7, 224, 148); padding: 2px;">
            <p style="margin-left: 10px; opacity: 0.7;">
              The session layer can also be associated with cookies. Imagine walking into a
              grocery store (the website), picking up items (user actions), and placing them in
              your cart (session data); even if you step away for a moment (reload the page), the
              cart still holds your items because the store (session layer) remembers your
              session, but if you leave for too long (session timeout), the cart is emptied, requiring
              you to start over unless you log in (persistent session), which allows the store to
              save your cart even if you return later.
            </p>
          </div>
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>[4] Transport Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The transport layer is responsible for delivering data across the network reliably and
          efficiently. It ensures that data is transferred correctly between devices, regardless of how
          it is broken down or routed. This layer manages segmentation, flow control, error
          detection, and retransmission to ensure data arrives intact and in order.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>Segmentation: Breaks large data into smaller packets to fit network limits and ensures correct reassembly at the receiver.</p></li>
          <li><p>Flow Control: Regulates the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming the receiver.</p></li>
          <li><p>Error Detection: Checks data integrity using checksums to identify and handle corrupted packets.</p></li>
          <li><p>Retransmission: Resends lost or corrupted data to ensure successful delivery.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think of this layer as a pizza delivery. Once the pizza has been made, packaged with all its toppings, and cooked, it gets sent off to where its supposed to go.</p>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="media/entrymedia/entry3figure5.png">
        </div>

        <p>
          During the transport layer, two main protocols are used depending on what’s being sent
          and how it’s being sent. <b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b>, which provides reliable, connection-oriented
          communication, ensuring all data is received correctly and in sequence. If packets
          are lost or arrive out of order, TCP requests retransmission. This is used for
          applications like web browsing, emails, and file transfers. <b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</b>, a faster, connectionless protocol that does not
          guarantee delivery or order but reduces latency. It is used for real-time applications
          like online gaming, voice calls, and video streaming.<sup><a href="https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/105429634/IJCTT-V7P151-libre.pdf?1693549236=&response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DOSI_Reference_Model_An_Overview.pdf&Expires=1738718680&Signature=UkVaOdBAGCowAunaG99sIVlwW4enFYQWaCkN1-OQE9s1W4QSQhjmskfoNR~RbKMj35CX1HKhEB7IfNKUkdXzV5Njaz5SDYp1IIhfVCMCy2qiK3um9cKF~N1~HaS5g8iXJKGiFqXX8ZQL~sPhpC7gFzLBtshMYC4HOA4kK~0wFg1WMGHkm7Q4EQtadlTZeyC9kJ0RTUAzJk3jDf-IBLtjXhZs3Kd49yNOKVAOznK~DZJkVzdj8NUoZ8S7U8-FfGn9ZJR6UncCENSe0GEG3I9mN7zo6MVPpTPRGMZd7MAv1lz7rlwJ9qCnN816FaCimufP50-E~byD5T8w0-rsr46VAw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA" target="_blank">6</a></sup>
          <br><br>
          When viewing websites, like this one, the TCP protocol is often used to ensure that all web
          page elements (text, images, scripts) are correctly received before displaying them to you.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>[3] Network Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The internet works because of network-to-network connections. It is responsible for
          routing data between devices across different networks. It makes sure that data packets
          find the best path from the source to the destination, even if the devices are on separate
          networks. This layer is essential for large-scale communication, allowing data to travel
          across multiple interconnected networks, such as the Internet. It essentially handles the
          routing of data between different networks.<sup><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=fde021097ce7440a44ecf61470778d72f99e307f" target="_blank">7</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
          Key protocols at this layer include the Internet Protocol (IP), which is important for routing
          and addressing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) for diagnostic and errorreporting purposes, and routing protocols like Routing Information Protocol (RIP) that
          manage the routing of data across networks.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Internet Protocol (IP) handles addressing and routing data packets across networks. It assigns unique IP addresses to devices and determines the best path for data but does not guarantee delivery or order.</p></li>
          <li><p>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for network diagnostics and error reporting, sending messages when issues like unreachable destinations or packet loss happen. It's useful for tools like ping and traceroute.</p></li>
          <li><p>Routing Information Protocol (RIP) helps routers determine the best path for data by sharing routing tables with other routers. It uses hop count as a metric, with a limit of 15 hops, making it suitable for small networks but inefficient for large ones.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="figure">
          <img src="media/entrymedia/entry3figure6.png">
        </div>

        <p>The network layer basically determines the best routing path to make sure the data reaches its destination.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h2>[2] Data Link Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The Data Link Layer provides reliable data transfer between devices on the same network.
          It ensures that framing, addressing, and error-checking are done correctly before sending
          out the data packet to the next device. It is subdivided into two sublayers; 
          <b>Logical Link Control (LLC) </b>manages error detection, flow control, and frame synchronization; 
          <b>Media Access Control (MAC) </b>Handles physical addressing and controls access to the shared network medium using unique MAC addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this layer, zero's and one’s travel between physically connected points, also known as
          nodes. And with these nodes, the data link layer ensures reliable none-to-node transfer.

        <p>
          The Data Link Layer is also a key target for cyberattacks since it handles the framing of data
          for transmission. Each frame contains a header, body, and trailer, and if attackers can
          intercept or alter these frames, they can compromise network security. Threats at this
          layer include MAC address spoofing, MAC flooding, VLAN hopping, and ARP poisoning, all
          of which can lead to unauthorized access, data interception, or network disruption.<sup><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/62546.62572" target="_blank">8</a></sup>

              <b>MAC Address Spoofing: </b>An attacker changes their device's MAC address to
              impersonate a trusted device, gaining unauthorized network access.
              <b>MAC Flooding: </b>An attacker overwhelms a switch with fake MAC addresses, forcing
              it into hub mode, which allows data to be intercepted.
              <b>VLAN Hopping: </b>An attacker exploits misconfigurations to jump between VLANs,
              gaining access to restricted network segments.
              <b>ARP Poisoning: </b>An attacker sends fake ARP messages, linking their MAC address to
              a legitimate IP, allowing them to intercept or manipulate network traffic.

        <p>
          From a cybersecurity perspective, securing the Data Link Layer is essential to prevent
          these threats and administrators use port security, dynamic ARP inspection, and VLAN
          segmentation to mitigate these threats and protect network integrity.

        <h2>[1] Physical Layer</h2>
        <p>
          The Physical Layer of the OSI model is the foundational layer of the OSI model and is
          responsible for transmitting raw data bits over a physical medium. Physical medium
          meaning cables, fiber optics, or wireless connections. This layer handles the electrical,
          mechanical, and procedural parts of the physical connection between devices, including
          the transmission of binary data in the form of electrical signals. It defines how the bits are
          physically transmitted, the cables and connectors used, and the voltage levels or radio
          frequencies that represent binary ones and zeros. And in case you don’t know, when dealing
          with computers or electrical circuits and wires, it all boils down to the flow of electricity.
          The ones and zeros you always hear about are just on and off switches of electricity. Those
          on and off switches, or 1’s and 0’s, or binary, hold data which is what it being transferred.
        </p>
        <p>
          For bit transmission, the physical layer converts data into a form that can be transmitted
          across the network. It transmits individual bits by encoding them into electrical pulses,
          light signals, or radio waves. For example, Ethernet cables use electrical signals, while
          fiber optic cables use light signals
        </p>
        <p>
          For data transmission Media, it determines the physical medium over which data is sent,
          such as copper wires (for Ethernet), fiber optics (for high-speed connections), or airwaves
          (for wireless connections like Wi-Fi or cellular networks).
          For signal timing and synchronization, the physical layer also times the transmission of
          signals. It ensures that devices can interpret when one bit ends and the next begins. It also
          includes clock synchronization, ensuring that the sender and receiver remain in sync.
          For data rate control, it determines the speed at which data is transmitted, also called the
          bit rate (measured in bits per second, bps), and controls the flow of data to prevent
          collisions and overload.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          From a cybersecurity standpoint, the physical layer can also be vulnerable since it deals
          directly with the transmission of data. A significant attack that can happen in signal
          jamming or any interference with wireless communication. This can lead to a denial-ofservice attack (DoS).<sup><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1618130114" target="_blank">9</a></sup>

        <h2>The Breach</h2>
        <p>
          The OSI Model is a standard model that segregates network communication into seven
          layers, each of which has functions specific to it. The Application Layer, Layer 7, makes it
          possible for users to interact with networked applications through HTTP, FTP, and SMTP
          protocols. The Presentation Layer, Layer 6, ensures that the data is well-formatted,
          encrypted, and compressed for the recipient system, hence character encoding and
          encryption. The Session Layer, Layer 5, establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions
          while providing synchronization and error recovery. The Transport Layer, Layer 4, provides
          for reliable data transfer through segmentation, flow control, and error detection, using
          protocols such as TCP and UDP. The Network Layer, Layer 3, provides routing and
          addressing of data packets across networks through the use of IP, making sure that data is
          routed to its destination through proper routing and addressing. Layer 2, the Data Link
          Layer, provides a reliable means of communication between devices on the same network
          by framing data for transmission and may address error detection and flow control. Lastly,
          the Physical Layer, Layer 1, defines the raw bit transmission across a physical medium,
          including cables, wireless, and connectors, and is thus the very foundational layer of all
          data communication.
