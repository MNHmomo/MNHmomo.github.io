            <h2>All Entries section</h2>
            <p>
                Sort of like an RSS feed, the "All Entries" section is a collection of all the blog entries I have written.
                These entries are listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent entries at the top.
                This is just a neater way of displaying all the entries that are posted, and seeing the icons of each side by side.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Activity Log</h2>
            <p>
                The Activity Log is a sort of display of all the updates done to the website. Some are minor updates like a
                new featured news section, new FAQ, or new trivia. Some are major updates, such as a new entry, update to the
                home page, or a new feature added. The small or big updates are resembled through the saturation of the boxes,
                with each box representing a day of the current month, of course to be reset every month reflecting the updates of that month.
                A lower saturated/darker green meaning a minor update was done that day, and a higher/brighter green meaning
                a major update was done that day. This little section is actually is actually inspired
                by the GitHub activity moniter. I though I'd recreate it.
                If you actually hover over a box, that isn't completely unsaturated, 
                you can see a little description of the update that was done that day. This is not supported on mobile viewing.

            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>TL;DR News Update</h2>
            <p>
                Last major <a href="entry6.html">website update</a>, I added a news section that highlights and summarizes recent and
                relevant infosec news. It still features that summarized news article, but now also links to extra relevent news.
                Having just one seemed like too little, so why not add a bit more. The extra are just links however, and do not
                feature a summarized section. So you will have to read them yourself.
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Certification Exam Practice Questions</h2>
            <p>
                Posted as a blog entry, the first includes practice questions for the CompTIA Security+ Certification exam. The number of
                questions will usually increase as more updates are done to the websites. Future entries will feature practice questions
                for other certifications, such as the CompTIA Network+, CompTIA A+, and others. They're useful whether you're actually going
                to take the certs, plan on doing so, or just want to test your knowledge and see where you're at.

            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Live Cyberthreat Map</h2>
            <p>
                This one is a pretty cool one. I found a live cyber threat map, <a href="https://cybermap.kaspersky.com/" target="_blank">The Kaspersky Cyberthreat Map</a>,
                which is an interactive, real-time visualization tool that shows current cyberattacks happening across the world. 
                It provides a live feed of cyber threats, including data on the types of threats, the countries being targeted, and the geographical spread of these attacks.
                The good thing is I found a way to embed this cyberthreat map, so I added it to the Home Page. 

            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>GitHub Repo Highlight</h2>
            <p>
                In the Home Page, I included a highlight of a GitHub repository that I find interesting. I'll usually update it every week as I find repo's
                relevant to cybersecurity, whether itis a tool, collection of tools, or a learning resource. It's just a way of spreading open source projects on GitHub
                for you to check out.

            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h2>Other Updates</h2>
            <p>
                I've worked better dark/light mode compatibility, improving contrast for a better viewing experience. 
                I have finally updated the <a href="architecture.html">architecture page</a>, going in depth as much as I can on the architecture of bashbreach.
                Another cool feature I've added is this cursor effect in the home page. Two bars, one at the top of the page and one on the left side of the page,
                dynamically follow the cursor while still stuck on those sides of the screen. There is also a pixel coordinate display 
                that follows the cursor. If these effects end up being distracting, you can disable them by toggling the checkbox underneath
                the main logo. It's a fun little effect to see.
